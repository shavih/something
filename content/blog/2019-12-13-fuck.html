<p>Have you ever had the urge to do things in two languages at the same time? It’s literally code-switching. When you’re at home and you’re talking to your mom or maybe your grandma, and you unwittingly switch between your home language and English?</p>
<p><strong>Your mom</strong>: තේ බොමු ද?<br />
<strong>You</strong>: Sure! Do we have any කිඹුල් බනිස්?</p>
<p>(maybe this is not a <em>universal</em> experience, but it is a common experience for a good chunk of people. I learned about code-switching in an intro to anthropology class.)</p>
<p>Anyway, kind of like that– you’re at home, you’re doing something in R, and you think to yourself, “hey. What if instead of doing everything in one perfectly good language, I throw in some garbage from another? I love making my own life hard! Maybe I’ll have to install a package!”</p>
<p>Lucky for you, we can use R and Python together in R studio. What a world, right?</p>
<p>Okay, so imagine you’re… doing some kind of homework. Oh, look! It’s everyone’s favorite dataset: the cars dataset! For some reason, you’ve never seen this dataset before, so you look at a summary of it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(cars)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00</code></pre>
<p>You see this and you’re like, “well. I do not believe this! There’s no way that the mean speed of these cars is 15.4 miles per hour!” In this hypothetical scenario, you’re hopelessly dumb so you think that using a whole different language will prove to you</p>
